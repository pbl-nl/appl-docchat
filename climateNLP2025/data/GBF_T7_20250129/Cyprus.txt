Government: Cyprus

National target title: Integration of biodiversity conservation goals into major sectoral policies, particularly fire management

Description: To achieve biodiversity conservation goals, these must be integrated into all sectoral state policies to ensure that they are considered during the preparation of development programs and to minimize the impact on biodiversity. This ensures the compatibility of activities in various sectors (like agriculture, livestock farming, fisheries, energy, tourism, construction, industrial development, infrastructure and public roadworks), with biodiversity conservation efforts. The Action Plan includes a program of measures to integrate biodiversity conservation goals into Cyprus' major sectoral policies. Particularly in the agriculture sector, a series of measures that contribute to biodiversity conservation will be implemented through the Rural Development Program. Also, special emphasis is placed on preventing and addressing fires, which constitute a significant factor in biodiversity loss in Cyprus.
