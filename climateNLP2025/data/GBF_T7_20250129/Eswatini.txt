Government: Eswatini

National target title: Target 7.1 By 2030, reduce pesticide use by 60% compared to baseline levels, focusing on phasing out highly hazardous pesticides and promoting integrated pest management (IPM) practices in agricultural production.

Description: nan

Main policy measures: nan

Aspects of the goal or target are covered: Target 7.1 aims to reduce pesticide use by 60% by 2030, focusing on phasing out highly hazardous pesticides and promoting Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices in Eswatini’s agricultural sector. This target is crucial given the country’s current reliance on pesticides, particularly in cash crop production, which contributes to water pollution, soil degradation, and harm to non-target species like pollinators. The contamination of rivers and wetlands, vital for biodiversity and human consumption, highlights the urgency of this issue. Reducing pesticide use through IPM and sustainable practices will mitigate these environmental risks, protect biodiversity, and enhance long-term agricultural productivity. Furthermore, addressing pesticide-related health risks for farmers and rural communities is essential for promoting safer, more sustainable agricultural practices. This target aligns with broader conservation goals and supports ecosystem resilience in Eswatini. Elements of the global target covered are: Reduce pollution risks and negative impact of pollution From all sources Levels that are not harmful to biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services Considering cumulative effects Risks from pesticides and highly hazardous chemicals Integrated pest management Taking into account food security and livelihoods

National target title: Target 7.3 By 2030, eliminate single-use plastics and reduce plastic waste by 60% compared to baseline levels through policy interventions, consumer education, and infrastructure development for waste management and recycling.

Description: nan

Main policy measures: nan

Aspects of the goal or target are covered: Target 7.3 aims to eliminate single-use plastics and reduce plastic waste by 60% by 2030 through policy interventions, consumer education, and the development of waste management and recycling infrastructure. This target is highly relevant for Eswatini, where the government has already taken decisive steps, including the planned ban on single-use plastic bags effective December 1, 2024. The ban, part of the broader Control of Plastic Bags Regulations of 2021, reflects the country’s commitment to addressing plastic pollution, which threatens biodiversity, public health, and ecosystems​. Despite efforts like the Phatsa Sakho Nawe campaign, which promoted reusable bags, plastic waste remains a significant problem. Achieving this target will require not only strong policy measures but also consumer education to shift behaviours and reduce plastic consumption. In addition, investing in waste management and recycling infrastructure is critical for reducing plastic pollution and supporting a circular economy. By combining regulatory action with community engagement and infrastructure development, Eswatini can significantly reduce its plastic footprint, contributing to both environmental sustainability and public health. Elements of the target covered are: Reduce pollution risks and negative impact of pollution From all sources Levels that are not harmful to biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services Considering cumulative effects Taking into account food security and livelihoods Preventing, reducing, and working towards eliminating plastic pollution

National target title: Target 7.2 By 2030, reduce nutrient losses (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) from agricultural sources by 60% compared to baseline levels through improved nutrient management practices, including precision agriculture, cover cropping, and wetland restoration.

Description: nan

Main policy measures: nan

Aspects of the goal or target are covered: Target 7.2 seeks to reduce nutrient losses, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, from agricultural sources by 60% by 2030, through improved nutrient management practices like precision agriculture, cover cropping, and wetland restoration. This target is crucial for Eswatini as nutrient runoff from agriculture leads to water pollution, soil degradation, and the loss of biodiversity, particularly through the process of eutrophication in water bodies. Excess nitrogen and phosphorus runoff causes algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and the death of aquatic species, severely impacting ecosystems, and water quality. Additionally, nitrate contamination in drinking water poses serious health risks, while nitrogen volatilization contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change. By adopting sustainable practices that reduce nutrient losses, Eswatini can protect its waterways, enhance soil health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve agricultural efficiency. This approach aligns with the country’s broader environmental and food security goals, promoting a healthier, more sustainable agricultural system. Elements of the global target covered are: Reduce pollution risks and negative impact of pollution From all sources Levels that are not harmful to biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services Considering cumulative effects Reducing excess nutrients lost to the environment Taking into account food security and livelihoods
