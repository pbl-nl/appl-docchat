National target title: T12: Public administration

Description: Note: This version is a draft. All targets and actions are being finalized and pending official Finnish Government decision. Target 12. The public administration works consistently and actively together with various actors to halt biodiversity loss: legislation, resources, other steering instruments and strategic planning guide the maintenance and improvement of biodiversity in all sectors. (Target year 2030.) This is a root cause oriented target. An important role of public administration is to strengthen and support citizens' ability to act for biodiversity and to tackle the root causes of biodiversity loss and pressures on nature. Strong sustainability, recognising the limits of nature's carrying capacity, should be a common goal of the whole public administration. Sustainability governance is not only about reducing unsustainable practices, but also about increasing sustainable practices. Voluntary action has so far not had a sufficient steering effect on the state of nature in all sectors. In legislative work, halting nature loss should be more strongly integrated as a starting point throughout government. This will require advice and training, for example to ensure a more comprehensive assessment of biodiversity impacts when drafting legislation. The scale of public procurement is significant, and therefore its redirection can reduce pressures on biodiversity. A predictable and consistent shift in public procurement towards services and products with less environmental impact will create forerunner markets and accelerate the development of sustainable production methods. Consistent and predictable public demand requires a strong focus on procurement governance and monitoring. Ecosystem accounting is one way to bring natural capital and its impacts into national accounts. Ecosystem accounting puts natural capital on an equal footing with other types of capital and allows economic policy to take into account the benefits of ecosystem services and the harms of human activities on nature. The knowledge base, methods and practices for ecosystem accounting need to be developed so that they can be used for planning and monitoring the national economy.

National target title: T11: Ecological footprint

Description: Note: This version is a draft. All targets and actions are being finalized and pending official Finnish Government decision. Target 11. The ecological footprint of Finns both in Finland and abroad will be significantly reduced. (Target year 2035.) This is a pressure oriented target. In Finland, overconsumption is one of the biggest challenges to sustainable development and our domestic material consumption per capita is among the highest in Europe. Finnish consumption of natural resources per person, and our ecological footprint, is among the highest in the world. Root causes must be addressed at systemic level and cannot be left to individuals, but require guidance, regulation and advice. Nevertheless, everyone needs to change their priorities and everyday behaviour in order to halt the loss of nature, and the state must promote opportunities for Finns to adopt lifestyles that are within the limits of nature's carrying capacity, so that everyone can contribute to positive developments in the protection of biodiversity.

National target title: T9: Pollution prevention

Description: Note: This version is a draft. All targets and actions are being finalized and pending official Finnish Government decision. Target 9. The risks of pollution will be reduced to a level that is not detrimental to biodiversity. (Target year 2030.) This is a pressure oriented target. At EU level, the REACH Regulation sets rules for the use, authorisation, monitoring and evaluation of chemicals by different bodies. Timely, rapidly updated monitoring information for all harmful substances is a prerequisite for effective protection measures and other environmental decision-making. A national chemicals programme up to 2035 will be implemented with the aim of improving chemical safety, ensuring and promoting the protection of human health and the environment. In Finland, regulatory control will ensure that humans and farm animals are not exposed to plant protection products, but environmental exposure needs to be further investigated. The use and risks of chemical pesticides must be reduced by 50% in the EU, and their use in urban green areas and other sensitive areas in the EU must be phased out completely, in line with the EU's Farm to Fork Strategy. Reducing emissions and air pollution, controlling agricultural run-off and urban and industrial waste water are key to preventing eutrophication and acidification. Finland is implementing programmes of measures in its water and marine management plans to reduce pressures from catchment areas and direct pressures on water bodies.

National target title: T7: Sustainable use of natural resources

Description: Note: This version is a draft. All targets and actions are being finalized and pending official Finnish Government decision. Target 7. Natural resources are utilised, managed and used sustainably so as to reduce pressures on biodiversity and improve the quality of habitats. (Target year 2035.) This is a pressure oriented target. Activities that have the greatest impact on biodiversity in Finland in terms of area are forestry (77% of Finland's total area), agriculture (8%) and construction (4%). According to red-list assesments the use of natural resources is the most acute threat to both species and habitats. Most of Finland's biodiversity occurs outside protected areas. The ecological sustainability of land use outside protected areas is therefore key to safeguarding biodiversity. To halt biodiversity loss, it is essential to reduce the need for biodiversity-degrading land use and the exploitation of virgin natural resources. This will be supported by, among others, increasing transparency in product value chains, better identification of impacts and strengthening resource productivity. The National Bioeconomy Strategy aims to achieve the 'more from less' principle, for example by modernising industrial production and increasing the added value of products. The carbon-neutral circular economy is one way of reducing pressures on natural resource use and can thus indirectly play an important role in halting biodiversity loss.

National target title: T6: Biodiversity loss & climate change

Description: Note : This version is a draft. All targets and actions are being finalized and pending official Finnish Government decision. Target 6. Halting biodiversity loss and mitigating and adapting to climate change will be promoted simultaneously . The implementation of the green transition avoids, minimises and, if necessary, compensates for the adverse effects on nature. (Target year 2035.) This is a pressure oriented target. Nature-based solutions can, for example, simultaneously sequester carbon, improve resilience to extreme weather events that will increase with climate change, and reduce water pollution. In urban environments, a multi-benefit nature-based solution is, in particular, the enhancement of green infrastructure such as green roofs, green streets and natural stormwater wetlands. Protecting and restoring carbon-rich ecosystems is a key solution to support both climate change mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity recovery. The network of protected areas should be actively developed to promote adaptation to climate change. More generally, the challenges to species conservation posed by climate change must be addressed by developing and implementing new tools. Finland must also prepare for the fact that as the climate zones shift northwards, many new southern species will arrive in Finland and more southerly species will continue to migrate northwards.

National target title: T4: Threatened and declined species & genetic diversity

Description: Note : This version is a draft. All targets and actions are being finalized and pending official Finnish Government decision. Target 4. The negative trend of increasing extinction risk of species has been halted and reversed. The genetic diversity of species is maintained, and populations of declined common species recover. (Target year 2035.) This is a state of nature oriented target. The target aims at decreasing the number of threatened species (red-list categories CR, EN & VU) and increasing the number of species that are of least concern (LC). Reviving the populations of common but declined species ensures that these species do not become threatened in the future. The achievement of the target  is measured by the red-list index for all species as well as by habitat-specific threat indices. The target is that the overall red-list index in 2035 is higher (better) than in 2019 and that the habitat-specific indices show a clear positive trend. Given that between 2010 and 2019, the red-list index declined significantly for some species groups and some habitats, achieving this target will require a significant change from past trends.

Main policy measures: To be added later once the related actions are approved by the government.

Aspects of the goal or target are covered: Decreasing the number of threatened species and increasing the number of species that are not threatened is arguably the most important target since species populations and diversity are the most fundamental dimensions of biodiversity. The restoration and protection of habitat as well as the sustainable use of species and natural resources all aim at maintaining viable populations of species. The fair and equitable use of genetic resources also depends on species diversity.

National target title: T3: Threatened habitat types

Description: Note : This version is a draft. All targets and actions are being finalized and pending official Finnish Government decision. Target 3. The negative trend in the threat statuses of habitat types has been halted and reversed. More habitat types are improving in terms of their red-list status than that are declining. Measures to improve the state of habitat types are targeted especially at threatened habitat types. (Target year 2035.) This is a state of nature orianted target. The threat status of habitat types in Finland has been evaluated twice (2008 & 2018). Almost half (48%) of the nearly 400 habitat types across the country were assessed to be threatened. The trend among many habitat types is assessed to be declining. This target aims to reverse that trend and improve the status of habitat types. Due to the slow process of habitat change, not all indicators or/and quality factors contributing to the threat assessment will improve by 2035, even with extensive habitat protection, restoration and management. The trend in habitat loss can be considered to be improving if sufficient measures have been taken by 2035 to create the conditions for an increase in the area of rare habitats and an improvement in the structure and function of degraded threatened habitats. In terms of cost-effectiveness, it is appropriate to focus initially on the habitats of greatest biodiversity value, i.e. sites that are particularly species-rich or whose management benefits endangered species.

Main policy measures: To be added later once the related actions are approved by the government.

Aspects of the goal or target are covered: As ecological communities habitat types contain all the biodiversity of the country. Improving their status is thus essential for achieving goal A and partly also Goal B.

National target title: T2: Ecosystem restoration

Description: Note : This version is a draft. All targets and actions are being finalized and pending official Finnish Government decision. Target 2. Ecosystem restoration is increased, which increases the connectivity of ecosystems and improves their functioning and ability to produce key ecosystem services. Nationally restored area increases towards the global goal of restoring 30% of degraded habitats. (Target year 2030.) This is a state of nature oriented target. Finland is committed to restoring degraded areas as part of the 30% national restoration target for degraded areas under the Convention on Biological Diversity. The EU Biodiversity Strategy does not have a similar explicit quantitative restoration commitment, but it does commit at EU level to halting the decline of species and habitats of community importance and to achieving a clear improvement in the status of 30% of species and habitats by 2030. In practice, this means large-scale restoration, rehabilitation and management of Habitats Directive habitats with an unfavourable conservation status, and enhanced conservation and management measures for species and their habitats under the Habitats and Birds Directives.

Main policy measures: To be added later once the related actions are approved by the government.

Aspects of the goal or target are covered: Restoration is one of key the measures to achieve Goals A & B.

National target title: National goal

Description: Note : This version is a draft. All targets and actions are being finalized and pending official Finnish Government decision. Goal: The loss of biodiversity is halted by 2030 so that nature starts to recover, and Finland is nature positive by 2035. This is an overarching goal of the Finnish National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan. During the first years of the strategy period, biodiversity loss as a whole will inevitably continue, even though some species might already recover, the state of habitats might improve and ecosystem functions might be restored. This is due to continuing anthropogenic pressures and to the fact that the sometimes significant ecological delays in the impacts of undertaken actions. The measures taken during the strategy period will contribute to the continued recovery of biodiversity in Finland even after the strategy period. Nature positive means that biodiversity loss is halted and reversed by 2035 on a 2020 baseline. The first part of the goal to halt biodiversity loss in Finland by 2030 is in line with the goal of the EU Biodiversity Strategy ("to put Europe’s biodiversity on the path to recovery by 2030 for the benefit of people, climate and the planet”) and the mission for the period up to 2030 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (“To take urgent action to halt and reverse biodiversity loss to put nature on a path to recovery for the benefit of people and planet by conserving and sustainably using biodiversity and by ensuring the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the use of genetic resources, while providing the necessary means of implementation.”). By halting biodiversity loss, Finland will respond to its international commitments.
