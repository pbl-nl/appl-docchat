National target title: NEPP 5, Strategic goal 1. Improving the environmental conditions for human health and quality of life, and reducing the impact of environmental pressures.

Description: This goal is part of the 5th National Environmental Protection Program (NEPP 5), which is not part of the NBS, however they mutually support each other.

Main policy measures: Strategic areas: Improving air quality Reducing noise pollution Providing healthy drinking water Sewage disposal and treatment, sewage sludge treatment and recovery Protecting green spaces,  developing green infrastructure

Government: Hungary

National target title: Target 6.1 Measures to reduce the use and risk of chemical pesticides, and to reduce the use of more hazardous pesticides.

Description: nan

Main policy measures: Using integrated pest management to increasingly replace chemical pesticides with agrotechnical and biological processes. Encouraging resistance breeding using traditional breeding methods. Reviewing desiccation practices. Regular controlling the use of banned chemicals – which often cause the poisoning of birds of prey – and the illegal or sub-standard use of legal pesticides. Finding alternative solutions to prevent emergency authorisations of unauthorised active ingredients. Promoting the collection of pesticide wastes and products withdrawn from commercial circulation, and their mandatory disposal at collection points. Full prohibition on the use of neonicotinoids in crops attracting pollinators. Monitoring the effects of chitin synthesis inhibitors on non-target organisms. Promoting sustainable use of pesticides, minimising risks, following good practice; encouraging the use of alternative technologies and developing technical advice service. Promoting and developing moderate, conscious and responsible behaviour of the industry, farmers and other pesticide users. Encouraging the environmentally friendly application of pesticides and biostimulants in agriculture according to the technological specifications.

National target title: Target 6.2 Improving the spectrum and species-specificity of external and internal parasiticides, and reducing their use.

Description: nan

Main policy measures: Supporting research to reduce pollution from antiparasitic products (external and internal parasiticides) in intensive livestock farming. Practical application of research results in livestock farming. Increasing and promoting mosquito-selective biological control methods (e.g. Bacillus thuringiensis ) to control mosquito populations. Introducing restrictive measures (e.g. buffer zone designation) for chemical mosquito control (deltamethrin) in organic farming areas and in green urban areas.

National target title: Target 6.3 Significantly reduce the adverse environmental impacts of crop yield and performance enhancers used in agriculture.

Description: nan

Main policy measures: Promoting integrated nutrient management. The Common Agricultural Policy includes provisions on the use of appropriate cultivation techniques, the restriction of row crops on slopes above 12%, the use of cover crops and the establishment of buffer strips, in order to reduce fertiliser use and thereby the resulting nutrient leaching by 50%. Promoting the use of organic manure and green manure from extensive farming to restore soil organic matter. Improving the legislation on and defining the strategic issues of soil protection, strengthening the legal guarantees and economic instruments for the protection of arable land. Supporting measures to protect soil life. Promoting prolonged waterlogging to prevent nutrients leaching from soil into surface waters. Reducing diffuse pollution of agricultural origin to reduce water pollution. Monitoring compliance with arable land and soil conservation regulations. Training, educating, and raising awareness to promote a change in farmers’ attitudes towards soil conservation and sustainable soil use. Providing farmers with information on good practices and methods to reduce negative environmental impacts of agricultural origin.
