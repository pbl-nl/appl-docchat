National target title: NBT-7: Reduce pollution risks and negative impact

Description: Reduce pollution risks and the negative impact of pollution from all sources by 2030 to levels that are not harmful to biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, considering cumulative effects by (a) reducing excess nutrients lost to the environment including through more efficient nutrient cycling and use; (b) reducing the overall risk from pesticides and highly hazardous chemicals by at least half, including through integrated pest management, based on science, taking into account food security and livelihoods; and (c) preventing, reducing, and working towards eliminating plastic pollution.

Main policy measures: Pollution (air, water, soil, and noise) by the widespread use of fertilizers and pesticides; urban and technological wastes; industrial effluents; vehicular traffic; burning of fossil fuels; etc. has emerged as one of the prominent drivers responsible for the decline of biodiversity; impact on the environment; and health of livestock, wild animals, and humans. All concerned ministries/ departments need to recognize this as a priority concern and develop, implement and monitor a comprehensive strategy and action plan to tackle this surmounting problem. Reduce excess nutrients lost to the environment by at least half through efficient nutrient cycling and use. Reduce the overall risk from pesticides and highly hazardous chemicals by at least half through integrated pest management based on science and considering food security and livelihoods. Prevent, reduce or work towards eliminating plastic pollution. Revisit existing policies, laws, strategies, guidelines, and rules relevant to the control of varied pollution, strengthen them and ensure stringent regulations and effective law enforcement, especially in the case of plastics, including in the sea environment, disposal and recycling of up surging urban and digital technology waste and pesticides.

Aspects of the goal or target are covered: •    Assessment and reduction of pollution risk •    Reduction of negative impact of pollution •    Sources of pollution •    Tolerable limits that are not harmful to biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services, and human well-being •    Consideration of cumulative effects •    Reducing excess nutrient loss to the environment •    Risks from pesticides and highly  hazardous chemicals •    Integrated pest management •    Aspects of food security and livelihoods •    Preventing, reducing, and working towards eliminating plastic pollution
