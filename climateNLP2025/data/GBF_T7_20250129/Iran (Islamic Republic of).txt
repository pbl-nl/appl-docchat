National target title: NT-8

Description: Minimize the impact of Iran’s contribution to the climate change and ocean acidification on biodiversity and increase its resilience through mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction actions, including through ecosystem-based approaches, while minimizing negative and fostering positive impacts of climate action on biodiversity.

Main policy measures: Actions, plans and aims Address specific vulnerabilities to climate change: Ensure that national climate resilience strategies take into account the specific vulnerabilities of women and girls, particularly in pastoralist, rural and agricultural communities. Provide targeted support to empower women in climate adaptation efforts, recognizing their key roles in managing natural resources and sustaining livelihoods. Develop climate resilience indicators with local participation: Work with villagers, pastoralists and nomadic tribes to develop indicators for tracking progress on climate resilience and biodiversity conservation. These indicators should be based on both scientific and traditional knowledge, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how ecosystems and communities are adapting to climate change. Support traditional seed conservation for climate-resilient agriculture: Promote the conservation and use of traditional and local seed varieties by traditional farmers both in situ and ex situ, which are often more resilient to climate change. These seeds and by this participatory approach for example through Evolutionary Plant Breeding have adapted over generations to local environmental conditions and can play a crucial role in sustaining agriculture in the face of climate variability. Promote multi-stakeholder collaboration for climate-resilient ecosystems: Foster collaboration between government agencies, scientific institutions, NGOs, villagers, pastoralists and nomadic tribes in implementing ecosystem-based approaches to climate resilience. Multi-stakeholder partnerships can enhance the effectiveness of ecosystem-based approaches, pooling resources and knowledge to tackle climate challenges. Protect and restore ecosystems critical to local communities: Prioritize the protection and restoration of ecosystems that are vital to the livelihoods of pastoralists, rural and agricultural communities, such as grasslands, wetlands, forests, and traditional grazing lands. These ecosystems play a central role in buffering the impacts of climate change, enhancing both biodiversity and community resilience.

National target title: NT-4

Description: Implement urgent management actions to halt the anthropogenic extinction of known threatened species and ensure their recovery and conservation. Reduce extinction risk, maintain genetic diversity within and between populations of native, wild, and domesticated species, and manage human-wildlife interactions to minimize conflict and promote coexistence.

Main policy measures: Actions, Plans, and Aims Emphasize local communities' role in sustainably managing wild species through traditional practices, integrating their knowledge into conservation strategies. Develop systems for sustainable use, harvesting, and trade of wild species, involving local communities and integrating traditional knowledge with modern practices. Encourage sustainable pastoralism, transhumance, and traditional harvesting methods that are culturally appropriate and ecologically sustainable. Educate local communities to monitor and report illegal and unsustainable use or trade of wild species, establishing community-based monitoring systems. Develop systems for the fair and legal trade of wild species, ensuring local communities receive equitable benefits, including better market access and fair pricing. Provide programs focused on sustainable harvesting techniques, biodiversity monitoring, and legal trade practices, developed in partnership with local communities. Ensure policies for sustainable use and trade of wild species support biodiversity conservation and local economic sustainability. Educate local communities to integrate traditional knowledge into the scientific management of species populations, ensuring sustainable resource use. Prevent the over-exploitation or extraction of wild species with appropriate safeguards. Foster ethical and sustainable practices for using wild species in national markets, enhancing community resilience.

National target title: NT-6

Description: Eliminate, minimize, reduce, and/or mitigate the impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) on biodiversity and ecosystem services by identifying and managing pathways for IAS introduction, preventing the introduction and establishment of priority IAS, reducing the rates of introduction and establishment of other known or potential IAS by at least 50% by 2030, and eradicating or controlling IAS in Iran.

Main policy measures: Actions, Plans, and Aims Engage villagers, pastoralists, and nomadic tribes in monitoring and managing invasive species that threaten local ecosystems and biodiversity. Their close connection to the land and water enables them to detect and manage IAS effectively. These programs should integrate scientific knowledge with traditional ecological knowledge, promoting a holistic approach to IAS management. Encourage traditional land management practices, such as rotational grazing, fire management, and sustainable agriculture, to reduce the spread of IAS. These methods, developed over centuries, can maintain ecosystem balance and prevent IAS from taking root. Engage local communities in habitat restoration projects aimed at removing IAS and restoring native biodiversity, thereby reversing the damage caused by IAS while restoring the cultural and ecological integrity of ecosystems. Advocate for legal reforms that support community-based IAS management initiatives, empowering local people to act as stewards of their environments. Establish monitoring systems that involve local communities in collecting data on IAS presence and impact, utilizing traditional knowledge to guide national efforts. Promote collaboration between communities across borders to share knowledge and best practices for managing IAS. Ensure that impact assessments for development projects include an analysis of IAS risks with full local community participation. Mitigate the impact of IAS on livelihoods, particularly for communities dependent on pastoralism, transhumance, fishing, and agriculture, ensuring resilience in the face of IAS challenges.

National target title: NT-3

Description: Ensure and enable that by 2030 at least 30% of Iran’s terrestrial and inland water areas, and marine and coastal areas, especially those crucial for biodiversity and ecosystem functions, are effectively conserved and managed. This should be done through ecologically representative, well-connected, and equitably governed systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures. Recognize the traditional lands of villagers, pastoralists, and nomadic tribes, integrating these into wider landscapes, seascapes, and the ocean, ensuring any sustainable use aligns with conservation outcomes and respects the rights of these communities.

Main policy measures: Actions, Plans, and Aims Achieve the 30% conservation target by 2030 by designating non-hunting prohibited areas and desirable natural areas near current protected areas, based on the IUCN Matrix. This includes establishing Urban Protected Areas (UPAs) and Private Protected Areas (PPAs) to create an ecological network. Ensure pastoralists’ and nomadic tribes' lands are included within the conservation target, as these areas often harbor high biodiversity and should be sustainably managed. Use a community-based approach to expand protected areas (PAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs), involving local people in their identification, governance, and management. Provide capacity-building programs on conservation practices, biodiversity monitoring, and protected area management to pastoralists and nomadic tribes, ensuring their knowledge systems are respected. Ensure conservation efforts provide co-benefits for biodiversity and the livelihoods of local communities, enhancing food security, promoting sustainable livelihoods, and addressing climate resilience.
