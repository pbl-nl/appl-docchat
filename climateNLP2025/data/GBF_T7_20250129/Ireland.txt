Government: Ireland

National target title: By 2026, Ireland is meeting all requirements for its transitional, coastal, and marine environment under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), thereby achieving and maintaining High or Good Ecological Status and Good Environmental Status, respectively

Description: nan

Main policy measures: DHLGH will implement and update national programmes of measures to achieve High or Good Ecological Status and Good Environmental Status within transitional, coastal, and marine waters, acting further to support OSPAR Decisions, Recommendations and Other Agreements, and to bolster marine biodiversity throughout the North-East Atlantic region. DHLGH will adopt and complete the integration of Ireland’s marine environmental targets established under the MSFD, and Water Framework Directive Status Objectives, into the planning, consenting and operational systems for human activities in Ireland’s maritime area, thereby ensuring the sustainable use of resources and the conservation of marine biodiversity and ecosystem services. DHLGH will enact and implement comprehensive legislation enabling the designation and management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and the expansion of Ireland’s network of area-based conservation measures in the coastal and marine environment. This legislation will cover species and habitats beyond those listed in EU Directives and also features providing ecosystem services including climate change mitigation and adaptation, and capturing transboundary considerations where possible, thereby acting further to support MSFD requirements, the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, and marine biodiversity throughout the region.
