National target title: State-oriented target 1-2: Extinction risk is reduced at the species level

Description: This is one of the three “state-oriented targets” which represents a state that should be realized by 2030 to achieve the “Basic strategy 1: Restoration to Healthy Ecosystems” and this target is set for the state of biodiversity at species level. <Background of the state-oriented targets of Basic strategy 1> Given that ensuring the soundness of all three levels of biodiversity (ecosystems, species, and genes) is essential for the overall health of the ecosystems in Japan, the government has set state-oriented targets for the soundness of each of these levels of biodiversity.

Main policy measures: Action-oriented targets, which represent actions to be implemented to achieve each state-oriented target, are set separately. Thus, actions to achieve this national target are mainly outlined in the sections for action-oriented targets 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 and 1-5.

Aspects of the goal or target are covered: This target corresponds to the following elements from GBF Goal A: Human induced extinction of known threatened species is halted, and, by 2050, the extinction rate and risk of all species are reduced tenfold and the abundance of native wild species is increased to healthy and resilient levels. The elements of the corresponding GBF targets are mainly outlined in the sections for the action-oriented targets 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 and 1-5.

Aspects of the goal or target are covered: This target corresponds to the following elements from GBF Goal A: The integrity, connectivity and resilience of all ecosystems are maintained, enhanced, or restored, substantially increasing the area of natural ecosystems by 2050.

National target title: Action-oriented target 3-4: Enhance sustainable, environmentally friendly agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, including reduction in risk-weighted use of chemical pesticides and chemical fertilizer use, and promotion of organic farming, as stated in MIDORI Strategy for Sustainable Food Systems

Description: This is an “action-oriented targets” which represents actions to achieve “state-oriented targets” that should be realized by 2030, to achieve the “Basic strategy 3: Realization of Nature Positive Economies”. <Description of this action-oriented target and its background> Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries are originally production activities that interact with nature, utilize it appropriately, obtain its blessings, and depend on appropriately maintained material cycles of biodiversity and nature. In Japan, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries have long played significant roles for biodiversity through creating unique local landscapes and natural environments, providing valuable habitat for a variety of species, and forming and maintaining ecosystems. At the same time, activities such as development of farmlands and waterways without consideration to environment, excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and overfishing, have degraded habitat of wildlife species and had a significant impact on biodiversity. In addition, in recent years, level of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries activities have been lowered due to depopulation of rural areas and decrease in population engaging in those activities, which has led to a decline in use of satoyama forests and the increase in abandoned farmland and subsequently to the decrease in number of living organisms which had been frequently found in the satochi-satoyama , while damage by wildlife has become more intensified as human activities had been abated. As agriculture, forestry, and fisheries are closely related to biodiversity in such a way, for maintaining and further developing agriculture, forestry, and fisheries as sustainable activities, not only producers but also the entire supply chain are required to recognize that biodiversity must be conserved. Based on those understanding, the government will promote sustainable agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, including reducing risk-weighted use of chemical pesticides and use of chemical fertilizers, and promote organic farming, in accordance with the MIDORI Strategy and the Biodiversity Strategy of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. People on the ground who are engaged in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries currently face challenges, such as decreasing number and aging of those engaged in those works, degradation of local communities, and decline in productivity. In order to achieve sustainable food production and reducing environmental impact while overcoming those challenges, the government will make effort to change behavior of relevant entities and enable innovations that will support them to do so. To promote efforts to reduce burden on biodiversity at all stages ranging from production to consumption in agriculture, forestry, livestock industry, and fisheries, the government will encourage relevant entities to actively carry out efforts, develop innovative technologies and production systems, and facilitate social implementation across society, and to disseminate know-how and develop human resources.

Aspects of the goal or target are covered: This target corresponds to the following elements from GBF Goal B: Biodiversity is sustainably used and managed and nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, are valued, maintained and enhanced, with those currently in decline being restored, supporting the achievement of sustainable development for the benefit of present and future generations by 2050. This target corresponds to the following elements from GBF Target 5: ・ Use, harvesting and trade ・ Wild species This target corresponds to the following elements from GBF Target 7: ・ Levels that are not harmful to biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services ・ Considering cumulative effects ・ Reducing excess nutrients lost to the environment ・ Risks from pesticides and highly hazardous chemicals ・ Integrated pest management ・ Reduce pollution risks and negative impact of pollution ・ Taking into account food security and livelihoods This target corresponds to the following elements from GBF Target 9: ・ Social, economic and environmental benefits ・ Customary sustainable use by indigenous peoples and local communities This target corresponds to the following elements from GBF Target 10: ・ Managed sustainably, in particular through the sustainable use of biodiversity ・ Biodiversity-friendly practices ・ Nature’s contributions to people

National target title: Action-oriented target 1-3: Reduce pollution (control emissions with the objective of reducing the impact on biodiversity to an appropriate level taking into account carrying capacity) and, implement measures contributing to preventing and reducing the negative impacts of invasive alien species (e.g., reduce the rate of establishment of invasive alien species by 50%)

Description: This is an “action-oriented targets” which represents actions to achieve “state-oriented targets” that should be realized by 2030, to achieve the “Basic strategy 1: Restoration to Healthy Ecosystems”. <Description of this action-oriented target and its background> Regarding pollution (e.g., chemicals in wastewater, pesticides, marine plastics, and others) and invasive alien species, which are also listed as one of the five direct drivers that seriously affect biodiversity loss identified in the IPBES Global Assessment Report, measures to reduce or mitigate their impacts are urgently needed based on the results of appropriate risk assessments and other information. For this purpose, the government will promote and enhance risk assessment of chemical substances and pesticides and risk management based on the assessment results, including their appropriate use; improve the water quality of rivers and lakes;take measures against pollution through control and collection of marine debris; expand border measures, control and appropriate management of invasive alien species (particularly living organisms for which urgent measures are required at the stage where there are great risks of their establishment in Japan or living organisms widely bred and with large outdoor populations); promote lifelong care for domestic animals and ensure their appropriate management. In addition to ensuring the continuation and reinforcement of those measures, there is a need to collect and utilize scientific knowledge and take further effective countermeasures.
