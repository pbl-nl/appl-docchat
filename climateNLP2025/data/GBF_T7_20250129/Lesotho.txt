National target title: Reduction of pollution to levels that are not harmful to biodiversity

Description: By 2030, pollution, including from excess nutrients, has been brought to levels that are not detrimental to ecosystem functioning and biodiversity.

Main policy measures: Lesotho has in place legal instruments aimed to curb pollution. The regulatory tools include; Environment Policy of 1998 and Environment Act of 2008, which have provisions for pollution control. Lesotho is no exception to global plastic waste menace and has therefore developed Plastic Levy Regulations of 2022 which aims at managing the use of plastic shopping bags by prohibiting plastic of inferior quality (less than 25 microns). It is mandatory in Lesotho to subject major development projects to Environmental and Social Impact Assessment to ensure environmental compliance. The process plays a critical role in ensuring that developmental activities do not pose high levels of pollution to human health and Environment. Additionally, the country has programmes and projects including Phase out Mercury added products, reducing open burning of waste which articulate pollution control issues.
