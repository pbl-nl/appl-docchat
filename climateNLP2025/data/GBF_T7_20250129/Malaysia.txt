National target title: NPBD TARGET 4: BY 2030, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY MAINSTREAMED INTO DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORKS

Description: Economic development remains a key national priority for Malaysia. Nonetheless, we must ensure that Malaysia’s aspirations to become a developed country entails sustainable and efficient utilisation of its land and natural resources. As such, biodiversity conservation must take place together with national development rather than in isolation. Mainstreaming biodiversity into the different sectors and development frameworks remains a crucial aspect of ensuring direct and indirect pressures on biodiversity are thoroughly and effectively addressed.

Main policy measures: Effective biodiversity mainstreaming requires ingraining the principles of this Policy into various facets of Malaysia’s economic sectors. Conservation principles and measures need to be considered and reflected during the development of new development policies, as well as in the revision of our current development plans. At the same time, we must also strengthen the monitoring processes to ensure development is pursued and conducted sustainably without imposing more pressures on biodiversity. Our valuation of biodiversity also needs to be strengthened and further incorporated into our planning frameworks to better reflect the country’s economic growth.

Aspects of the goal or target are covered: The actions in the NBSAP are mapped to align with the global targets.
