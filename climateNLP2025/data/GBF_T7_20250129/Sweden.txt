National target title: The generational goal

Description: The structure of the environmental objectives adopted by the Riksdag on the basis of the Government’s proposals in Government Bill ‘Sweden’s Environmental Objectives – For More Effective Environmental Action’ (Govt Bill 2009/10:155, bet. 2009/10:MJU25, Riksdag Comm. 2009/10:377) includes a generational goal that, together with its seven indents, has the following wording: The overall goal of environmental policy is to be able to pass on to the next generation a society in which the major environmental problems have been solved, without increasing environmental and health problems beyond Sweden’s borders. This calls for an ambitious environmental policy - in Sweden, in the EU and in international contexts. The generational goal means that the conditions for solving environmental problems are to be met within one generation and that environment policy should be directed towards ensuring that: – ecosystems have recovered, or are on the way to recovery, and their long-term capacity to generate ecosystem services is assured, – biodiversity and the natural and cultural environment are conserved, promoted and used sustainably, – human health is subject to a minimum of adverse impacts from factors in the environment, at the same time as the positive impact of the environment on human health is promoted, – materials cycles are resource-efficient and as far as possible free from dangerous substances, – natural resources are managed sustainably, – the share of fossil-free energy increases and use of energy is efficient, with minimal impact on the environment, and – patterns of consumption of goods and services cause the least possible problems for the environment and human health. The generational goal functions as a directional goal for the environmental policy and provides guidance concerning the values that are to be protected and the societal transformation required to achieve the desired environmental qualities.

National target title: Energy, research and innovation

Description: Courtesy translation: The overall objective of the energy policy is to create conditions for efficient and sustainable energy use and a cost-effective Swedish energy supply with low negative impact on health, the environment and the climate, as well as to facilitate the transition to an ecologically sustainable society. The obejctive is based on the same three pillars as the common energy policy in the EU and aims to unite security of supply, competitiveness and ecological sustainability. The overarching objective for energy research and innovation is to contribute the energy and climate targets, the long-term energy and climate policy and energy-related environmental policy. The Riksdag (the Swedish Parliament) has also concretized three sub-targets, the first of which states that research and innovation in the field of energy must provide scientific and technical knowledge and competence needed to, through the application of new technology and new services, enable a transition to a long-term sustainable energy system in Sweden, characterized by combining ecological sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply.

National target title: Milestone target: Eutrophication

Description: The milestone target means that by 2030 steadily increasing amounts of manure are used in a resource-efficient way so that both the losses of nitrogen to air and water and the losses of phosphorus to water are steadily reduced over time, through an annual follow-up, it is ensured that the supply of nitrogen and phosphorus to water decreases over time in accordance with Sweden's commitments in the Baltic Sea Action Plan, and that these reduction commitments are achieved within set time frames, and through an annual follow-up, it is ensured that the supply of ammonia to the air is reduced in accordance with Sweden's commitments in the NEC directive (national emission ceilings) and that this reduction commitment is reached within set time frames. (The milestone targets are intended to identify a desired social change and specify steps towards achieving the generational goal and one or more of the environmental quality objectives.)
