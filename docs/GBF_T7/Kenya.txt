National target title: Target 18: Identify and reduce harmful incentives, and promote positive incentives for biodiversity

Description: Identify by 2025, and progressively eliminate, phase out or reform incentives, including harmful subsidies on biodiversity reducing them by at least 10% annually, starting with the most harmful incentives, and promote positive incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.

Main policy measures: Conduct a comprehensive review of existing incentives and subsidies to identify those harmful to biodiversity by 2025. Develop a strategic plan to phase out or reform harmful incentives in a proportionate, just, fair, effective, and equitable manner Introduce timelines and milestones for phasing out less harmful incentives progressively by 2030. Develop and implement positive incentive schemes that promote conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Raise public awareness about the importance of biodiversity and the impacts of harmful incentives through educational campaigns and workshops. Collaborate with international organizations and other countries to share best practices and learn from successful biodiversity incentive programs.

Aspects of the goal or target are covered: Once harmful incentives are identified, the next steps involve eliminating, phasing out, or reforming these programs. This requires policy changes and the creation of new frameworks that prioritize biodiversity conservation. By eliminating harmful incentives and promoting positive ones, the target aims to restore and expand natural ecosystems. Enhanced, or restored, substantially increasing the area of natural ecosystems by 2050; Reforming harmful incentives supports sustainable development by promoting practices that conserve biodiversity. Adequate financial resources are necessary for identifying and reforming harmful incentives and promoting positive ones. Investments in these reforms will be critical to ensuring long-term sustainability. The first step is to identify incentives and subsidies that harm biodiversity. This involves comprehensive reviews and assessments of current policies, programs, and subsidies to understand their impacts on biodiversity Many harmful incentives are embedded in existing policies or programs Positive incentives include subsidies, grants, or legal measures that promote biodiversity-friendly practices. Positive incentives are economic, legal or institutional measures designed to encourage activities beneficial to biodiversity. Incentives related to the use, harvesting, and trade of natural resources should be aligned with biodiversity conservation goals. This includes promoting sustainable practices and discouraging overexploitation. Reduce pollution risks and negative impact of pollution.Policies should aim to reduce pollution risks, especially those impacting biodiversity, ensuring cleaner, healthier ecosystems. Levels that are not harmful to biodiversity and ecosystem functions and service Incentives should discourage practices that lead to excess nutrient runoff, promoting methods that reduce these pollutants and protect aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.s
