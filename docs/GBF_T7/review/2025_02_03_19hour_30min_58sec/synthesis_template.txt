What kind of pollution does the country describe in the text? Describe all the pollution types that are found in the text. Example pollution types are excess nutrients, pesticides, hazardous chemicals, fertilizer, industrial waster water, micro-plastic, plastic, nitrogen, municipal solid waste, underwater noise pollution. If any other pollution types are mentioned, also include them.	Based on the provided summaries, the countries can be clustered into three main categories:   1. **No Specific Target Mentioned**: These countries either do not specify any particular types of pollution or provide a general mention of pollution without detailing specific types. Examples include Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Comoros, Cook Islands, Cyprus, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Honduras, Kazakhstan, Liberia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovenia, South Africa, South Sudan, Suriname, TÃ¼rkiye, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, and Zimbabwe.  2. **General Target for Pollution Reduction**: These countries mention pollution types but do not specify detailed targets or strategies for each type. They generally aim to reduce pollution levels to protect biodiversity and ecosystems. Examples include Angola, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia, Botswana, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Nauru, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Togo, Tunisia, United Republic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Venezuela, and Yemen.  3. **Specified Target for Pollution Reduction**: These countries have specific targets or strategies for reducing particular types of pollution. They often include quantitative goals or detailed plans for addressing pollution. Examples include Algeria, Austria, Canada, Chad, Chile, European Union, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  **Summary of Clusters**:  - **No Specific Target Mentioned**: This cluster includes countries that either do not mention specific pollution types or provide a general overview without detailing specific targets. The focus is often on broader environmental or biodiversity goals without explicit pollution reduction strategies.  - **General Target for Pollution Reduction**: Countries in this cluster identify various pollution types affecting their environments but do not provide detailed targets or strategies for each type. The emphasis is on reducing pollution to protect biodiversity and ecosystems, often through general policy measures or initiatives.  - **Specified Target for Pollution Reduction**: This cluster includes countries with clear, specific targets or strategies for reducing particular types of pollution. These countries often have quantitative goals or detailed plans, indicating a more structured approach to pollution management and reduction.
