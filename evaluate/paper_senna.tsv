The number of estimated averted hospitalisations was highest for age group 70–79 years, both absolute (32,483, of which 30,268 in the subperiod) and relative to observed hospitalisations (63.5 % in the entire period and 73.3 % in the subperiod). The lowest numbers were observed for agegroup 12–49 years: 7,607 (37.3 %) estimated averted hospitalisations, of which 7,255 (49.9 %) in the subperiod. During the Alpha period, an estimated 1,826 (8.1 %; 95 %CI 1,767–1,876; 7.8 %–8.3 %) hospitalisations were averted by vaccination ( Fig. 4 ). The largest number of hospitalisations was averted during the Delta period, both in absolute (57,395; 95 %CI 55,918– 58,723) as well as relative (72.3 %, 71.8 %–72.8 %) terms. In the Omicron period, an estimated 38,949 (63.4 %) admissions were averted (95 %CI 37,749–40,152, 62.7 %–64.1 %). 4. Discussion We aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in the Netherlands in terms of averted hospitalisations. Results showthat the vaccination campaign has had a considerable, positive impact on an important indicator of COVID-19 health burden – admission to hospital – which reinforces the investment in the vaccination programme for preventing serious disease at the patient level, reducing the associated burden on the healthcare system, and retaining capacity to admit non-COVID-19 patients. An estimated 98,170 (57.0 %) admissions have been averted from the start of the vaccination campaign, of which 90,753 (67.9 %) in the period where all adults had the opportunity to complete the primary series and children aged 12–17 were eligible for vaccination (subperiod). An upward trend can be seen in the fraction of averted hospitalisations from younger to older age groups, with a peak for age group 70–79'
 '.0 % and 67.9 % of all estimated hospital admissions. Estimated averted hospitalisations were lowest for 12–49-year-olds and highest for 70–79-year-olds. More admissions were averted in the Delta period (72.3 %) than in the Omicron period (63.4 %).Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccination prevented a large number of hospitalisations. Although the counterfactual of having had no vaccinations while maintaining the same public health measures is unrealistic, these ﬁndings underline the public health importance of the vaccination campaign to policy makers andthe public. /C2112023 The Author(s).

Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous negative impact on health and wellbeing worldwide. COVID-19 has directly affected public health with over 600 million conﬁrmed cases to date, and more than 6.5 million deaths [1]. In the Netherlands, with a total population of 17.7 million individuals, approximately 8.5 million COVID-19 cases have been conﬁrmed by surveillance monitoring from February 27, 2020, up to August 30, 2022, of which approximately 113,000 have resulted in hospitalisation and more than 22,000 in death [2]. Several times during the pandemic, the intensive care units (ICU) were overwhelmed. This imposed pressure on hospital staff, causing a shortage of staff and delaying surgical procedures [3]. Also, this pressure increased the need tointroduce drastic infection control measures in the community']"	['70-79 year olds.']

Because observed hospitalised individuals can be admitted to hospital more than once, we did not remove them from the risk set. We thus also retained averted hospitalised persons in the population at risk for future hospitalisations. We estimated the absolute and relative number of averted hospitalisations per period in which a virus variant was dominant. We deﬁne the start of a dominant period as the time that a variant comprises at least 50 % of all test samples of infected individuals that are sequenced by the pathogen surveillance in the Netherlands [31]. The periods we use are: - Wildtype: From the start until February 14, 2021 - Alpha: February 15 until June 27, 2021 - Delta: June 28 until December 26, 2021 - Omicron: December 27, 2021 until August 30, 2022 For hospitalisations we use the estimated date of disease onset (date of hospitalisation – 7 days) to determine the dominant virus variant period. 3. Results Vaccine coverage of the primary series on August 30, 2022, ranged from 73 % for age group 12–49 to 94 % for 70–79-year-olds(Fig. 1 .A). At the start of the subperiod on August 2, 2021, when all adults in the Netherlands had the opportunity to complete their primary series, coverage varied from 41 % (age group 12–49) to 92 % (age group 70–79). In general, the coverage in older age groups was higher compared to younger age groups for primary, ﬁrst and second booster vaccination ( Fig. 1 .A–C). Daily VE estimates for all ages (12 years and older) and per age group are shown inAppendices I and II .
