        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "What kind of terrestrial and inland water areas will specifically be protected?", "ground_truth": "Priority ecosystems will be identified, among which primary and mature forests, wetlands (including peatlands), grasslands. Additionally, forests that are not considered mature, but represent the most mature examples for those types of forest habitats of which there are no mature forests left in Spain or are very scarce, will be strictly protected."},
		{"question_type": "initial", "question": "In which way will the terrestrial and inland water areas be conserved and managed?", "ground_truth": "One third of the areas, thus 10% of the surface area, will be under strict protection. A national monitoring system will be established to evaluate the state of conservation of protected areas, which can be used to decide on in which areas protection is a priority. By 2030, all Natura 2000 Network protected sites will be encouraged to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures."},

        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "In which way are the costs and benefits of the terrestrial and inland water areas shared?", "ground_truth": "Mobilization of the necessary resources is guaranteed, for example at least 1,408 million euros per year is required for the effective management of Natura 2000 areas. Other protected area networks such as the National Parks Network and the Spanish Network of Biosphere Reserves will also be taken into account for the mobilization of resources."},

By 2030, all Natura 2000 Network protected sites will be encouraged to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures. In the marine area, MITECO will implement a monitoring and surveillance system to ensure conservation."},
