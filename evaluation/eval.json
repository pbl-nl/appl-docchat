Water plays a role in freeze-thaw weathering; the formation of ice crystals that expand and crack the rock further, especially after the ice thaws again and seeps even deeper into the crack and freezes again. Water may also play a role in salt crystal growth; after the salty water has dried up and the salt crystals form in the crack, then water vapor may be attracted to the salt crystals and expand them even further."},

        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Why does calcite only generally occur in soils of relatively arid regions?", "ground_truth": "Calcite generally occurs in soils of relatively arid regions because these regions the evapotranspiration is larger than the precipitation, therefore, potentially dissolved calcite cannot leach out of the soil or be removed by run-off. During dry periods the calcite can precipitate again in the soil."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Describe the colloidal system and indicate why one type of clay mineral may have a higher capacity to attract cations than others.", "ground_truth": "The colloidal system is comprised of fine clay particles and highly decomposed humus. Soil colloids are highly reactive materials with electrically charged surfaces. Due to their small size, they give the soil a huge reactive surface area. Clay minerals may have different crystalline structures and consequently their reactive surface area and amount of surface charges may differ. Clay minerals with a large reactive surface area have a higher capacity to attract cations than others."},

        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Which soil will have the higher CEC: a non-swelling clay soil with a small effective surface area, or a sandy, slightly acidic soil containing a large amount of humus particles?", "ground_truth": "A sandy, slightly acidic soil containing a large amount of humus particles: humus particles are often the smallest soil colloids and therefore have a large surface area and a large negative charge. Depending on pH of the soil solution, the CEC of humus may be very high, much higher than non-swelling clays."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "What could happen if all living organisms in the soil died?", "ground_truth": "It would give a very problematic situation because decomposition of soil organic matter would stop entirely. This means that there is no more mineralization and respiration, and plants (debatebly also a ‘soil organism’) would not be able to take up nutrients because also biochemical weathering of parent material would stop (also done by soil organisms). In short, also all plants would die and all soil-related C would stay in the soil. Photosynthesis will also come to a halt and soil C cycling would be totally obstructed (no more C fluxes between the soil and the atmosphere or the soil-related biosphere). There would be no more food production, or other soil ecosystem services, possible. The oceans would need to take over all C cycling with the atmosphere. Of course this is a totally drastic situation, but it illustrates how important and crucial the soil is."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Give at least three reasons why organic matter cannot be decomposed by soil organisms.", "ground_truth": "If the soil pH is < 4 (or even lower; some decomposition will take place even with pH below 4, but it is not a lot). If the organic matter is too hard to decompose (so low quality organic matter). If temperatures are too low. If the soil is too dry."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "What is the main difference between humification and mineralization?", "ground_truth": "Humification is the transformation of raw organic matter into organic polymers (resistant against microbial actions) and mineralization is the transformation of organic forms of nutrients into inorganic forms (as a result of microbial activity)."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "How does the soil food web stimulate the breakdown of organic matter?", "ground_truth": "First dead organic matter is eaten by primary consumers; primary consumers are eaten by secondary consumers; etc. By eating each other organic matter is broken down, and nutrients and carbon pass through several trophic levels and ultimately become available for plant uptake."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Which grouping of organisms forms the base of the soil food web?", "ground_truth": "Primary producers."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Why are keystone species in a soil ecosystem important?", "ground_truth": "Keystone species are much more important for certain soil processes than other soil ecosystem species."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Give an example of how keystone species may greatly impact the soil.", "ground_truth": "Ecosystem engineers like earthworms create biopores (channels/burrows) through which air and water can move."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Why is a soil consisting of sedimentary layers of well-sorted material unfavourable for plant roots?", "ground_truth": "In a well-sorted soil all grains have the same size and therefore all pores have a similar size; all pores are either air-filled  or completely filled with  water, so either  plant roots  cannot take up  water (and dissolved nutrients) or plant roots suffer from lack of oxygen."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Bioturbation by soil animals results in the homogenization of soil layers but creates a heterogeneous pore system. Why is this not a contradiction in terms?", "ground_truth": "Bioturbation is the process by which soil animals mix organic matter into the soil, and homogenize the soil horizons of the top soil. Soil structure is improved by bioturbation. By creating biopores and by mixing organic matter into the soil, soil animals contribute to a PHCP of the soil (permanently heterogeneous connected pore system). This heterogeneous pore system is made up of pores with variable sizes and is essential for plant roots and thus plant growth. So by homogenizing the soil, soil animals create a heterogeneous pore system."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Name the four basic processes of soil formation", "ground_truth": "Additions, Losses, Translocation, and Transformation."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "give one specific example of each of the four processes.", "ground_truth": "Additions of organic matter to the soil from fallen leaves or from left crop residues on the fields. Loss of materials by erosion; volatilization of gases; leaching to the groundwater. Or by harvesting products from the land. Dissolved organic substances or salts, or clay may move vertically or laterally through the soil profile, usually with water as translocation agent. Material may be chemically changed by weathering (inorganic material) or decomposition (organic material)."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Why are concentrations of organic acids in the soil solution relatively low in hot climates?", "ground_truth": "In hot climates decomposition of organic matter is faster, and therefore decomposition is less dominated by fungi producing organic acids."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "A distinction is made between zonal and intra-zonal podzol soils. What factors explain where on Earth these podzol soils can be found?", "ground_truth": "Zonal podzol soils have average-rich parent materials and are mostly affected by climate (wet and cold), so they can be found in the boreal climate zone. Intra-zonal podzol soils have extremely poor parent materials, and are in comparison with the zonal podzol soils much less affected by climate."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Of the five soil-forming factors (parent material, climate, organisms, topography and time), choose two that have had a dominant influence on the development of a podzol soil.", "ground_truth": "Parent material and climate are the dominant soil-forming factors in the development of a podzol soil. Very poor parent materials (coarse texture and poor mineralogy) support plants and trees that produce low-quality litter that is mainly decomposed by fungi. Fungi produce organic acids that form complexes with organic polymers and Fe and Al. These complexes (chelates) move down the soil profile with percolating rainwater. Decomposition of organic material in cold and wet climates is slow and is also dominated by fungi that produce organic acids, etc."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Name the three preconditions for gley formation.", "ground_truth": "Lack of Oxigen, Presence of organic matter, Presence of heterotophic anearobic bateria."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "In a groundwater gley soil the iron mottles are mostly seen around large cracks and cavities. Why?", "ground_truth": "When groundwater levels drop, oxygen will enter the soil first through cracks and open channels (e.g. biopores); oxidation of Fe will then proceed."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "In what way will the activities of soil organisms change the structure of ripening soils?", "ground_truth": "Plant roots extract water from the ripening soils, and burrowing soil animals as well as plant roots increase the permeability of these soils by creating biopores. Soil animals also mix the soil and change soil structural elements by digging, eating and excreting. Flat-faced prisms and angular blocky soil structure types will become more rounded and columnar and subangular blocky structures will form."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Why do acid sulfate soils form especially in coastal plains and much less in non-marine environments?", "ground_truth": "Acid sulfate soils form especially in coastal plains because marine sediments will contain sulfate (SO42-), which is needed to form H2S. Reduced iron reacts with H2S to form pyrite (FeS2). If FeS2 oxidizes when oxygen enters the soil during biological and physical ripening processes, sulfuric acid is produced. Soils where these processes occur are called acid sulfate soils."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Distinguish between the direct and indirect effects of human activities on soil formation.", "ground_truth": "Direct effects of human activities on soil formation are made by in-situ disturbances, for example by destroying vegetation, tilling or terracing the soil, or by backfilling excavations that were created by opencast mining. Indirect effects of human activities on soil formation are effects that can extend far beyond where people live. For example, by polluting the air all sorts of polluting substances enter soil systems far from where the pollutants were produced (cities and industrial areas). Air pollutants can be fine dust, emissions of greenhouse gases and the formation of sulfur dioxide. Consequences are acid rain and environmental effects that can be linked to global climate change."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "The WRB has a straightforward architecture comprising two levels of categorical detail. Explain what each level entails.", "ground_truth": "The first level involves allocating a soil to one of the 32 Reference Soil Groups. The second level consists of combining the RSG with one or more principle and supplementary qualifiers."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Compare a large area (>10,000 km2) that has similar soil-forming factors with a small area (<10 km2) in which the soil-forming factors vary greatly. Which of the two areas will have the greatest soil heterogeneity?", "ground_truth": "The small area will have greater soil heterogeneity because it is not so much the size of the area but the variation in soil-forming factors that counts."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Why is the mean highest groundwater table in the Netherlands observed in winter and the mean lowest in summer?", "ground_truth": "In summer there is more evapo-transpiration because the temperature is higher and plants use more water."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Why does soil vary much more vertically than horizontally?", "ground_truth": "because of the soil-forming processes, which lead to soil horizons and great vertical variation."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Imagine you are a banana farmer. At what depth in the soil would you like the soil survey to concentrate?", "ground_truth": "At the depth where the banana plants have their roots. As it happens, the roots of a banana plant can reach up to 150 cm deep."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Soil surveys made a long time ago may have become outdated and no longer be valid. Why?", "ground_truth": "That is because the soil is not static but changes over time. Soil development is not a fast process so soil maps may last for multiple decades, unless substantial land use change occurs. Under land use change (such as nature to agriculture conversion and vice versa, urbanisation) the soil will change much more quickly so that soil maps become outdated more quickly."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Digital soil mapping makes use of maps of environmental covariates representing the soil-forming factors. For instance, climate may be represented by mean annual temperature and rainfall derived from remote sensing images. Name examples of environmental covariates that represent the soil-forming factors parent material, topography and organisms.", "ground_truth": "Parent material: geology maps. Topography: elevation, slope angle, curvature. Organisms: biomass, vegetation type, land cover."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Name at least five concrete examples of covariate maps that represent the soil-forming factor ‘terrain’.", "ground_truth": "Elevation, slope angle, aspect, curvature, upstream area."},
        {"question_type": "initial", "question": "Define effective rooting depth", "ground_truth": "The effective rooting depth is the depth above which ~85% of the roots grow. It gives you the depth of the root zone, the soil layer where most of the roots grow."}
