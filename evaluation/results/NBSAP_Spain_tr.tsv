				What kind of terrestrial and inland water areas will specifically be protected?	Priority ecosystems will be identified, among which primary and mature forests, wetlands (including peatlands), grasslands. Additionally, forests that are not considered mature, but represent the most mature examples for those types of forest habitats of which there are no mature forests left in Spain or are very scarce, will be strictly protected.	"The terrestrial and inland water areas that will specifically be protected include:

1. Hydrological reserves, aiming to achieve a network of more than 3,500 km of natural river reserves.
2. Lake Nature Reserves and Underground Nature Reserves in all intercommunity river basins.
3. Ramsar sites and protected natural areas associated with the water environment.
4. Areas within the Natura 2000 Network associated with the water environment.

These efforts are part of the broader goal to maintain the good condition of water bodies and to monitor the impacts of climate change on river ecosystems."

				In which way will the terrestrial and inland water areas be conserved and managed?	One third of the areas, thus 10% of the surface area, will be under strict protection. A national monitoring system will be established to evaluate the state of conservation of protected areas, which can be used to decide on in which areas protection is a priority. By 2030, all Natura 2000 Network protected sites will be encouraged to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures.	"The terrestrial and inland water areas will be conserved and managed through several strategies:

1. **Sustainable Forest Management**: Common basic guidelines for sustainable forest management will be approved to facilitate planning and incorporate biodiversity conservation. Close-to-nature forestry guidelines approved by the EU will be applied whenever possible.

2. **Silvopasture and Agroforestry Systems**: These systems will be encouraged and promoted to favor greater diversity and biodiversity in the territory.

3. **Wetlands Conservation**: According to the 2030 Wetlands Strategic Plan, the goal is to ensure no protected wetland will have worsened its conservation status by 2030, with at least 50% showing improvement or a strong positive trend. Efforts will also be made to maintain the good condition of other water bodies and protect hydrological reserves.

4. **Protected Areas**: In line with the EU's Biodiversity Strategy 2030, new protected areas will be identified and designated, aiming for 30% of terrestrial and marine environments to be protected, with one third under strict protection. Specific action plans will be developed for Ramsar sites, protected natural areas, and the Natura 2000 Network associated with the water environment.

5. **Unique Forests Management**: For unique forests requiring constant human activity, management will ensure the maintenance and improvement of their values and conservation status.

6. **Green Infrastructure and Ecological Connectivity**: Public Administrations will evaluate and identify elements of the territory that provide value from the perspective of green infrastructure, focusing on areas important for ecosystem services, biodiversity maintenance, and ecological connectivity.

These actions will be carried out in accordance with the developments of the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030."	"['To guarantee the conservation of natural heritage and biodiversity in the management  and use of forests, common basic guidelines for sustainable forest management will be  approved in 2023 to facilitate the planning of this management in any type of forest and  the forestry uses carried out therein, incorporating the consideration of biodiversity  conservation, and applying whenever possible the new guidelines for close-to-nature  forestry approved by the EU.\n\nOn the other hand, silvopasture and agroforestry systems  will be encouraged and promoted as a model favoring greater diversity in the territory and  therefore greater biodiversity.\n\nAquatic ecosystems (rivers and wetlands).\n\nAccording to the 2030 Wetlands Strategic Plan, the goal is that by 2030 no protected  wetland (RN2000/Ramsar/ENP) will have worsened its conservation status, and that at  least 50% will have improved or at least show a strong positive trend.'

				In which way will the terrestrial and inland water areas be connected?	Spain will contribute to the future Trans-European Nature Network, using ecological corridors.	The terrestrial and inland water areas will be connected through the implementation of ecological restoration measures in river corridors. These measures include eliminating longitudinal and transverse barriers, improving the liquid and solid flow regime of watercourses, functional permeabilization for fauna, expanding the space of fluvial freedom, and restoring and regenerating riparian ecosystems. This will improve river connectivity and associated riparian forests, contributing to the achievement of good status or good potential of the associated water bodies by 2030.	"['Likewise, progress will be made in  identifying the sections of transport routes and other infrastructures where the greatest  conflicts with the conservation of species and habitats occur or may occur, as well as  those areas that present the best opportunities for maintaining or restoring ecological  connectivity.\n\nIn order to increase road safety and the protection of species, especially the most  endangered ones, the technical requirements for the reduction of habitat fragmentation  caused by linear infrastructures will be applied in all environmental impact statements.\n\nAccordingly, all new projects will incorporate the necessary measures for the  permeabilization of infrastructures, the reduction of the effects they cause, both at the  edges and on the margins, and the reduction of wildlife mortality.'

				In which way are the costs and benefits of the terrestrial and inland water areas shared?	Mobilization of the necessary resources is guaranteed, for example at least 1,408 million euros per year is required for the effective management of Natura 2000 areas. Other protected area networks such as the National Parks Network and the Spanish Network of Biosphere Reserves will also be taken into account for the mobilization of resources.	The costs and benefits of terrestrial and inland water areas are shared through various integrated management plans and initiatives. These include the implementation of the Water Framework Directive and the Flood Risk Assessment and Management Directive, which aim to integrate biodiversity conservation needs into river basin and flood risk management plans. Additionally, land and coastal stewardship initiatives focus on ecological restoration, and Biosphere Reserves serve as laboratories for testing and replicating sustainable development projects. Furthermore, interventions co-financed with the EAFRD support voluntary environmental and climate commitments, forest restoration, and compensatory payments for economic restrictions due to conservation directives. These efforts collectively contribute to the sustainable management and conservation of natural resources, benefiting both terrestrial and inland water areas.	"['Within the framework of the implementation of the Water Framework Directive and the  Flood Risk Assessment and Management Directive, efforts will be intensified to ensure  the full integration of biodiversity conservation needs (habitat types and water-dependent  species) in the planning and implementation of river basin management plans and flood  risk management plans developed in the third planning cycle.\n\nThus, water plans must include the necessary measures to contribute effectively to  progress towards a favorable conservation status of habitat types and species linked to  water, addressing the water requirements of wetlands and Natura 2000 Network areas  linked to water, in the terms set out in the Strategic Plan for Wetlands to 2030, and  contributing to support the fight against invasive alien species in aquatic environments  and to promote the application of nature-based solutions whenever possible.'

One third of the areas, thus 10% of the surface area, will be under strict protection. A national monitoring system will be established to evaluate the state of conservation of protected areas, which can be used to decide on in which areas protection is a priority. By 2030, all Natura 2000 Network protected sites will be encouraged to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures. In the marine area, MITECO will implement a monitoring and surveillance system to ensure conservation.	"Marine and coastal areas will be conserved and managed through several key strategies:

1. **Approval and Application of Management Instruments**: Significant progress will be made in the approval and application of management instruments for marine protected areas under state jurisdiction. This includes the approval of new management plans for 58 marine areas of the Natura 2000 Network and the Marine Protected Area of the Mediterranean Cetacean Migration Corridor by 2025, and the updating of management plans for 25 marine areas of the Natura 2000 Network by 2023.

2. **Monitoring and Surveillance System**: MITECO will implement a monitoring and surveillance system in the marine environment, coordinated with actions by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Autonomous Communities, and other administrations and entities. This system will use the necessary technical and human resources to ensure effective monitoring and surveillance.

3. **European Union's Biodiversity Strategy 2030**: In line with the EU's Biodiversity Strategy 2030, which aims for 30% of protected areas in both terrestrial and marine environments, with one third under strict protection, new areas will be identified and designated, or existing protection regimes will be revised to contribute to the strict protection target of 10% of the surface area of existing protected areas by 2030.

4. **Coordination Guidelines**: Coordination guidelines will be approved between the General State Administration and the Autonomous Communities and Cities to improve marine biodiversity management. Coordination mechanisms will also be established with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Civil Guard, Maritime Rescue, and other entities for the surveillance of Marine Protected Spaces and endangered marine species.

5. **Integration of Natural Heritage and Biodiversity**: In the development of maritime management plans and marine strategies, natural heritage and biodiversity will be integrated into human activities at sea. This aims to improve the compatibility of human uses and activities, such as fishing, maritime transport, and renewable energies, with marine ecosystems.

2. **Development of Maritime Management Plans and Marine Strategies**: In the development of these plans and strategies, human activities at sea will be integrated with natural heritage and biodiversity considerations. This integration aims to improve the compatibility of human uses and activities with marine ecosystems, suggesting that stakeholders involved in these activities (e.g., fishing, maritime transport, renewable energies) will have a role in the decision-making process.

3. **Coordination and Cooperation Mechanisms**: Coordination guidelines and mechanisms will be established between various governmental bodies (e.g., the General State Administration, Autonomous Communities, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) and other entities (e.g., Civil Guard, Maritime Rescue) for the surveillance and management of marine protected areas and endangered species. This indicates a collaborative approach involving multiple stakeholders.

4. **International Collaboration**: Cooperation for sustainable development in biodiversity and ecosystems will be promoted with regions and countries outside the EU, and collaboration within regional marine conventions and international biodiversity protection bodies will be strengthened. This suggests that international stakeholders will also participate in governance and decision-making processes.

Other protected area networks such as the National Parks Network and the Spanish Network of Biosphere Reserves will also be taken into account for the mobilization of resources.	"The costs and benefits of the terrestrial and inland water areas are shared through various mechanisms and strategies aimed at maintaining and improving biodiversity, ecological connectivity, and natural resources. These include:

1. **Public Administration Evaluations**: Public Administrations evaluate and identify elements of the territory that provide current or potential value from the perspective of green infrastructure, which includes areas important for ecosystem services, biodiversity maintenance, and ecological connectivity.

2. **Voluntary Environmental and Climate Commitments**: Interventions co-financed with the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) include voluntary environmental and climate commitments, compensatory payments for natural restrictions, and investments in agricultural and forestry holdings.

3. **Eco-Schemes for Farmers**: Farmers who participate in eco-schemes receive payments for commitments that exceed baseline requirements, generating environmental benefits such as improved soil structure, reduced erosion, increased soil carbon content, and reduced soil emissions.

4. **Rural Development Interventions**: These interventions include compensatory payments for economic limitations due to the application of the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive, aimed at supporting rural development while conserving natural resources.

5. **Nature-Based Activities**: The conservation and enhancement of biodiversity and natural heritage also create opportunities for job creation and economic dynamism through nature-based activities like nature tourism and recreational activities.

These strategies ensure that the costs and benefits are distributed among various stakeholders, including public administrations, farmers, and local communities, contributing to both environmental sustainability and rural development."	"['On the other hand, in the case of other unique forests or  stands that require constant human activity for their maintenance, it will be guaranteed  that their management will ensure the maintenance and, if necessary, the improvement of  their values and conservation status.\n\nAll these actions shall be carried out taking into  account the developments that the European Commission is undertaking in application of  the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030.\n\nTo ensure the functionality of the biodiversity of the terrestrial and marine territory in  the long term, and as part of the lines of action of the National Strategy for Green  Infrastructure and Ecological Restoration and Connectivity, the Public Administrations will  evaluate and identify the elements of the territory that provide current or potential value  from the point of view of green infrastructure, that is, areas of special importance for the  provision of ecosystem services, maintenance of biodiversity and ecological connectivity.'
 'Some of these  practices will also favor biodiversity associated with agricultural areas, landscapes and  the conservation of natural resources such as water and soil.\n\nIn addition, interventions co-financed with the EAFRD have been programmed for  voluntary environmental and climate commitments, other than those of the eco-schemes  and investments, both in agricultural holdings and in forestry (prevention of forest fires,  forest restoration and other non-productive investments in forestry systems), as well as  compensatory payments for specific natural restrictions or limitations to economic activity  as a result of the application of the Habitats Directive in the Natura 2000 Network and the  Water Framework Directive, within what are known as rural development interventions.'
 'Farmers who join the eco-schemes will receive remunerative  payments for undertaking commitments that go beyond the baseline through a menu of  practices that cover the different conditions present on Spanish farms, generating  environmental benefits in areas such as improving soil structure, reducing erosion and  desertification, increasing soil carbon content and reducing soil emissions.\n\nSome of these  practices will also favor biodiversity associated with agricultural areas, landscapes and  the conservation of natural resources such as water and soil.'

Additionally, efforts will be made to identify and address conflicts with species and habitat conservation along transport routes and other infrastructures, and to incorporate measures to reduce habitat fragmentation and wildlife mortality. Furthermore, river basin management plans and flood risk management plans will include measures to support the conservation status of water-dependent habitats and species, promoting nature-based solutions whenever possible.
