Therefore, f urther research is required on spatial, spectral and  temporal dynamics of passive fluorescence  in photosynthetic organisms (Magney et al. 2017 ;  Mohammed et al. 2019 ). In addition, transferring laboratory results from variable fluorescence  measu rements to field situations should be done with caution, as growing environments, sampling  protocols and sensor operating conditions may differ (Maxwell & Johnson, 2000; Mohammed et al.  2019).     Méléder et al. (2018) performed laboratory experiments to stu dy the detectability of photosynthetic  parameters measured with PAM fluorometry and from hyperspectral informatio n (VIS-NIR  reflectance ; measured with a spectroradiometer) . To this end, rapid light curves ( RLC’s ) were  performed using a Diving -PAM on diatom suspensions  of an epipelic and epipsa mmic growth form   to obtain the rETR and light use efficiency (LUE or photosynthetic efficiency)'
 '. (1996) , iii) field measurements of photosynthetic parameters ( α  and E opt) using PAM fluorometry and iv) a tide model. It was assumed that MPB migrate upward  within the first hour after emersion (Paterson et al. 1998). The model could be optimized by use  of  the MST instead of ambient temperatures  to obtain P max (Daggers et al. 2018) or the Pb (Méléder  et al. 2020) . Furthermore, Méléder et al. (2020) suggested i) the use of benthic chambers instead  of PAM fluorometry, as the conversion factor EE between ETR and carbon fixation rates  may vary  with season , site and species (Barranguet and Kromkamp, 2000)  and ii) the direct use of the NDVI  instead of a conversion of the NDVI to chl-a. The obtained primary production rates corresponded  reasonably with field measurements (Fig. 3).'
 '. (2020). The required scripts to obtain production would need to be  requested from the authors  or adapted from scripts of Daggers et al. (2018) .    When the method of Daggers et al. (2018) is used, the method could be optimized  by using mud  surface tempe rature instead of ambient temperature to obtain the Pmax following the temperature - Pmax relationship of Blanchard et al. (1998), as suggested by Méléder et al. (2020). The mud  surface temperature can be derived from the model of Savelli et al. (2018). Mud surface  temperatures are known to increase with 2 -3 °C per hour (Guarini et al. 1997), while air  temperatures do not display such extreme fluctuations. As Pmax is directly related to temperature,  using a mud surface temperature model may significantly impr ove primary production estimates.   It is advised to calibrate the silt content for each separate satellite image when using the method  of Daggers et al. (2018).  By using the method of Daggers et al'

(2017) performed a laboratory experiment in which PAM measurements , leaf -level gas exchange  and spectrally resolved fluorescence was measured on leaves of Acer palmatum  and Quercus  lobata . Strong relationships were  found between variable fluo rescence (F λ, 670-850 nm ) and  PAM  fluorescence parameters  (Ft and F m). The relationship is , however,  dependent on the wavelength  of the fluorescence emission curve , nonphotochemical quenching and photosystem II yield  (photosynthetic efficiency) . Therefore, f urther research is required on spatial, spectral and  temporal dynamics of passive fluorescence  in photosynthetic organisms (Magney et al. 2017 ;  Mohammed et al. 2019 )']"	['Yes, the study was found to be a success.']
