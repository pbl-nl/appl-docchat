 '.With continued withdrawal of water for transpiration and evaporation, narrower pores are emptied leading to a sharp decrease in SWP. As SWP approaches pF 4.2 (-16,000 hPa or in absolute terms 16 times atmospheric pressure of 1 bar), roots can no longer exert adequate suction to absorb water, which results in severe dehydration of plant tissue, stomatal closure and critical wilting. Leaves may not recuperate be-yond this point, even after water application, leading to Permanent Wilting. The mo-ment of occurrence of this irreversible situation varies between plant species, and may also be triggered by excessive dry power of the air during an extreme combina-tion of hot, dry and windy conditions in addition to a persistent drought period.The residual water beyond pF 4.2 can only be extracted from the soil matrix by drying in an oven at 105 ∞C (i.e. beyond the boiling point of water) up to a SWP of pF 7.

docset_wur	2023-11-01 11:39:04.830763	what happens when transpiration losses are down?	The effect of reduced transpiration losses is that less water is lost from the plant through evaporation, which means more water is available for other essential processes such as nutrient uptake and photosynthesis. This can lead to improved water use efficiency and potentially higher crop yields.	0.8885017937676117	0.1904761904761904	1.0	0.0	"["". Concurrently, dissolved soil nutrients are taken up and transported along with the water ﬂow towards the leaves to be incorporated in the plant's tissue. Finally, water sustains rigidity of herbaceous crops (turgor), holding up leaves to effectively capturing sun light. Soil water demand in crop production is not limited to transpiration. Water is also lost directly from the soil surface by evaporation, especially when the canopy of a young crop is not fully covering the soil yet. This unproductive loss of soil water com-petes with water availability for crop transpiration and associated production.As canopy closes during the growing season, a smaller share of soil water is evaporated. Crops which quickly close their canopies will more efﬁciently use soil wa-ter through transpiration. Adequate availability of soil nutrients also improve Water Use Efﬁciency (WUE) by speeding up crop growth and associated canopy closure. This notion is of particularly important in prudent use of irrigation water.The amount of water available to plants depends on soil water content and soil characteristics. The soil water content follows from a water balance keeping track of water ﬂows entering (+ a.o. rainfall, irrigation) or leaving (- a.o. transpiration, evapora-tion) the rooting zone. Soil characteristics modify the rate of ﬂow, as illustrated here for a clay and sandy soil (next slide).""
 ""2Soil water for food supplySoils provide a medium for anchoring crops through their roots, keeping stems and leaves in an upright position, and enabling crops to capture solar energy in the process of photosynthesis. Water lost during this process by transpiration from the leave surface, is replenished by roots as they draw water from the soil. Although with-in reach of roots, soil water is not entirely available to crops as some water is retained within soil pores: clay soils, with more and smaller pores than sand, are characterized by a higher water holding capacity. As such clay may sustain crop water requirement over longer periods of drought. Crop yields are proportional to water uptake implying the need for supplementary water through irrigation in drier regions. Soil type is an important factor in tuning water management to realize more crop per drop while miti-gating salinization as potential threat to soil degradation.Water makes up 70-90% of the cropss fresh weight. This corresponds with roughly 40,000 litres of water incorporated in a mature ﬁeld crop on 1 hectare of land (or an average sea container on a soccer ﬁeld). During a dry, windy summer day, however, more than the entire water content of the crop is easily lost by transpiration.Transpiration protects leaves from overheating when they are necessarily ex-posed to sun light, energizing the ﬁxation of CO2 from the air into organic compo-nents as stored in a.o. grains and tubers. While CO2 enters small pores (stomata), at the leaf surface in this process, known as photosynthesis, water from the moist leaf tissue interiors is inevitably lost into the drier air.Transpiration losses are normally replenished through soil water taken up by plant roots. Concurrently, dissolved soil nutrients are taken up and transported along with the water ﬂow towards the leaves to be incorporated in the plant's tissue""]"	['plants under these conditions experience temporary wilting.']	3.0
docset_wur	2023-11-01 11:39:04.830763	how residual water beyond pF 4.2 can be extracted from the soil?	Residual water beyond pF 4.2, which is not readily available to plants, cannot be easily extracted from the soil. This is because the water is held tightly by the soil matrix forces and is not easily accessible to plant roots. However, certain plants with deep root systems or specialized mechanisms may be able to extract some of this residual water over time. Additionally, natural processes such as rainfall or irrigation can help replenish the soil moisture and make more water available to plants.	0.8940343161688755	0.2727272727272727	0.8	0.0	"['.

Clay particles have a larger water adsorbing surface area, while smaller pores retaining more water. This leads to an overall higher soil matrix forces, which implies that relatively high amounts of moisture are contained by the soil at pF 4.2 that is not available to plants. The ﬁne soil particles in combination with the high moisture retention lead to the sticky properties of clay soils; that classiﬁes clay as a heavy soil difﬁcult to till, for instance. By contrast, sand is classiﬁed as a light soil.The higher water holding capacity of a clay soil allows plants to bridge longer pe-riods of drought compared to a sandy soil, which could easily last over 2 months con-sidering rooting depth and transpirational demand.
