It is characterized by distinct layers or horizons that have been formed through the processes of addition, loss, transformation, and transfer of energy and matter. Soil provides a habitat for various organisms and plays a crucial role in supporting plant growth. It is influenced by factors such as climate, parent material, topography, organisms, and time, which contribute to its unique physical, chemical, biological, and morphological properties. Soil classification and understanding its properties are essential for making informed decisions in various fields, including agriculture, forestry, urban planning, and environmental management.	0.844661042453778	0.17391304347826086	0.8571428571428572	0.5	"['.

 '.   1.3 The object classified in the WRB   Like many common words, ‘soil’ has several meanings. In its traditional meaning, soil is the natural medium  for the growth of plants, whether or not it has discernible soil horizons (Soil Survey Staff, 1999).      In the 1998 WRB, soil was defined as:   “… a continuous natural body which has three spati al and one temporal dimension. The three main features  governing soil are:   • It is formed by mineral and organic constituents  and includes solid, liquid and gaseous phases.   • The constituents are organized in structures , specific for the pedological medium. Th ese structures form  the morphological aspect of the soil cover, equivalent to the anatomy of a living being. They result from  the history of the soil cover and from its actual dynamics and properties'

Therefore, to assess its quality it is necessary to measure, describe, and  classify its properties.     Soil cla ssification is necessary to predict its behavior and identify limitations that allow us to make correct  management decisions in the agricultural, livestock, forestry, urban, environmental, and health fields to name  a few of the most important . IUSS soil sc ientists understood all that and the consequent urgent necessity to  create an international soil classification system for name soils and create soil map legends based on a global  reference system'

It is the portion of the soil profile where roots can penetrate and access resources necessary for plant growth. The effective rooting depth can vary depending on factors such as soil texture, compaction, presence of limiting layers, and availability of water. It is an important parameter to consider in agriculture and land management practices as it directly affects plant productivity and water availability for plants.	0.8860771127425154	0.0	1.0	0.0	"['granular s tructures m ake root growth, water in filtration and p ercolation sig nificantly h arder .

 "".The water balance keeps track of the overall amount of water (in mm) present in the rooting zone. Not all of this water is available to the plants, when soils become ei-ther too wet or too dry. To extract water from the soil, roots exert some force propor-tional to the force of suction, by which water is drawn into the pores between the soil particles, or retained by the soil's organic matter. This suction force is expressed by the Soil Water Potential (SWP) with inherently negative values, or by its logarithmical equivalent, known as the pF-value.The pF value of a water saturated soil equals 0, as soils virtually soaking in water do not exert any suction force to retain water. Assuming all pores to be ﬁlled with wa-ter, the volumetric soil moisture content (SMC) complements the solid fraction. This is as high as 40% for a sandy soil""

On a slope, unless the parent  material starts at smaller depth, the profile depth  (Figure 8.4) should be 1 m  / cos(α). For the decision if the  thickness and depth criteria of the WRB are fulfilled and when calculating element stocks (Prietzel &  Wiesmeier, 2019) , the layer thickness perpendicular to the slope is needed. This is calculated multiplying the  vertical thickness by cos( α).      Figure 8.4: Correct profile depth when terrain is inclined     The profile should be 1 m wide. If on a slope, the profile wall must be parallel to the contour lines']"	['The effective rooting depth is the depth above which ~85% of the roots grow. It gives you the depth of the root zone, the soil layer where most of the roots grow.']
