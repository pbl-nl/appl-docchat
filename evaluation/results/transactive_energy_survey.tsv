 '. This paper proposes a novel P2Ptransactive trading scheme based on the multi-actor-attention-critic (MAAC) algorithm, which addresses the above challengesindividually. This method is complemented by a P2P trad-ing platform that incentivizes prosumers to engage in localenergy trading while also penalizes each prosumer’s addition torebound peaks. Case studies involving a real-world, large-scalescenario with 300 residential prosumers demonstrate that theproposed method signiﬁcantly outperforms the state-of-the-artMADRL methods in reducing the community’s cost and peakdemand.

The specific coordination mechanism studied according to the grid-edge coordination taxonomy presented in the paper is not mentioned in the given context.	0.8870818888350707	0.3333333333333333	1.0	0.9166666666666666	"['. The proposed taxonomy provides a clear and objective tool for transparently laying out structural assumptions in the design of future grid-edge resources coordination strategies. We analysed the literature through the lens of this taxonomy with both a systematic literature review and a detailed mapping of 93 strategies onto the coordination categories. As fundamental changes in the make-up and the structure of the electricity grid are calling for transitions to new coordination paradigms, the systematic literature review identified fast emerging research themes such as the decentralisation of energy resources, growing privacy concerns, and distributed network constraints management. As research efforts are increasing exponentially, doubling approximately every 4'

 '. Some reviews focus on one type of grid-edge resource only, for example on residential thermal energy storage [14] or deferrable loads [15]. Others focus on specific segments of the electricity grid, such as on the residential context [16,17], or on microgrids [18–21]. Previous reviews have analysed particular coordination methods such as market-based coordination [5, 6,9,22–26], optimisation [27], particle swarm optimisation and genetic algorithms [28] and reinforcement learning (RL) [7]. Others have investigated specific technological tools enabling coordination, such as distributed ledger technologies (DLT) [29] and digital tools such as modelling, simulation and hierarchical control [30]. Tohidi et al. review grid-edge resources coordination indirectly, by investigating the possible interactions between local and central electricity markets [31]. Guerrero et al'
 '. Tohidi et al. review grid-edge resources coordination indirectly, by investigating the possible interactions between local and central electricity markets [31]. Guerrero et al. investigate the technical issues associated with the implementation of behind-the-meter DERs coordination strategies in a low-voltage network [32]. Despite all these individual thematic reviews, there is no systematic review and taxonomy of the field of coordination of resources at the edge of the electricity grid with applicability across energy technologies. The terminology used to categorise DER coordination strategies within the literature have overlaps and inconsistencies, with terms such as ‘‘peer-to-peer’’, ‘‘multi-agent’’ or ‘‘transactive energy’’ which may refer to coordination frameworks with fundamentally different structural features']"	['mediated competition']
