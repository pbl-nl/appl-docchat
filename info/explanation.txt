# Welcome!

#### How to use this app

- To start chatting with documents in natural language, first create a folder in a place of your choice (e.g. "Y/User/xxxx/ChatPBL/docs with xxxx your user name) and put the documents you would like to chat with in that folder.<br>
- Once the document folder is created, copy-paste the path from the address bar in Windows File Explorer (leftclick at the right of the address in the address bar, then Ctrl+C) to the text box in the left sidebar, and hit Enter. The app then lists all the relevant files (.pdf, .docx, .txt, .html and .md) available in the folder for chatting in the multiselect box below the text box containing the folder path.<br>
- Select all documents in the folder (default) or make a selection of files. Once you have finished your selection, click the GO button. If you use the chosen document(s) for the first time, their content, divided into 'text chunks', are added to a 'vector database'. This will take some time, depending on the number of files and their size, so please be patient... The app will also detect any changes in the document folder that was chosen (added, updated or deleted files) and will update the vector database accordingly.<br>
- Once the creation of the vector database is finished, the prompt bar will appear at the bottom of the page. You can now start chatting with your documents by entering your prompt and hitting Enter.<br>
- The answer to a question will be a given in the language that was used for the question. Once an answer is returned, you can verify the validity of the answer by checking the document chunks that were used as source by the app to create the answer. Sources are shown both in plain copy-pasteable text and also highlighted in images of the particular page of the original document where the source was found (.pdf and .docx files only)<br>
- The app has memory which means that a follow-up question can refer to an answer that was given to the previous question. When you ask a question that has no relation with the previous one, it is recommended to clear the conversation with the 'Clear conversation' button.

_**summaries**_<br>
It can be useful to start the chat with a summary of the selected documents. There is a choice between a concise summary and a more detailed summery. Warning: creation of a detailed summary can take a long time for larger sized documents!<br>
Summaries will be created in the language of the source document. Once summaries have been created for certain documents, they will be stored to save time the next time you use the app<br>    

#### How text chunks are selected

This app is based on so-called vector similarity search, hence the creation of the vector database. This means that both the text chunks in the vector database and your prompt are converted to numerical vectors.<br>
In this way, the distance between the prompt vector and all available chunk vectors in the database is calculated. A number (this is a setting) of 'closest' chunks are then selected, assuming that they contain the answer to the question.<br>
From your prompt and the selected text chunks, a context is created (see this as an extended prompt). Finally, a Large Language Model is used to formulate the answer to the original prompt, based on the context.<br>
All this means that the words that you use in your prompt influence the values ​​in the numerical vector and therefore which chunks are chosen. In general, the more specific you are with the words you use in your prompt, the more specific (and better) the answer will be.

_**limitations**_<br>
This technique of vector similarity search also implies that this app is not very good in answering questions that requires knowledge of relationships between text chunks from different documents, or in answering 'meta' questions like: "What are the most important themes in the documents?". Another technique to store information will be applied in the future to circumvent these shortcomings<br>

#### Closing the app again

This is a 2-step process: first close the browser tab by hitting the EXIT button, then close the terminal that was used to launch the app
