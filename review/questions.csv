Analyze the retrieved document context and return a response based on the User Query below.
Context: {context}

User Query: {question}

Assign each country to one and only one of the following classes:

class 1: the context doesn't mention pollution from excess nutrients
class 2: the context mentions pollution from excess nutrients but has no quantified target to reduce that type of pollution
class 3: the context mentions pollution from excess nutrients but the quantified target is lower than 50% reduction
class 4: the context mentions pollution from excess nutrients AND also the quantified target is at least 50% reduction.

Just return output in the format country: class number

Examples:
- if country X mentions pollution from excess nutrients but has no quantified target to reduce that type of pollution, the output would be X: 2
- if country Y mentions pollution from excess nutrients but the quantified target is lower than 50% reduction, the output would be Y: 3",,y,"no mention
